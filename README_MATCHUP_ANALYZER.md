## Example Prediction Output

```markdown
**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The Maple Leafs host the Bruins in what promises to be a high-intensity 
Atlantic Division showdown. Toronto's explosive offense faces Boston's 
stingy defensive structure, creating a classic clash of styles.

**KEY MATCHUP FACTORS**

Home Ice Advantage:
- Maple Leafs boast a 7-2-0 home record, feeding off Scotiabank Arena energy
- Historical success suggests 65% win probability at home vs Boston

Offensive Firepower:
- Toronto averaging 3.4 goals/game, 4th in NHL
- Boston's disciplined system allows only 2.5 goals/game
- Edge: Maple Leafs in raw scoring, Bruins in defensive efficiency

**PREDICTION**

Winner: Toronto Maple Leafs
Confidence: 7/10
Expected Score: 4-2 Maple Leafs

Key to Victory:
- Maple Leafs: Capitalize on power plays, maintain offensive pressure
- Bruins: Limit odd-man rushes, strong defensive-zone coverage
```

## Cost Considerations

### OpenAI API Pricing (GPT-4 Turbo)
- **Input**: ~$0.01 per 1K tokens
- **Output**: ~$0.03 per 1K tokens
- **Per Analysis**: ~$0.05-$0.10 (typical)

**Monthly Estimate:**
- 100 analyses = ~$5-10
- 500 analyses = ~$25-50

üí° **Tip**: Start with a small credit balance to test!

## Customization

### Change AI Model

Edit `matchup_analyzer.py`:

```python
# For faster/cheaper predictions
model="gpt-3.5-turbo"  # ~$0.001 per analysis

# For best quality (current)
model="gpt-4-turbo-preview"  # ~$0.05 per analysis

# For maximum capability
model="gpt-4"  # ~$0.10 per analysis
```

### Adjust Analysis Depth

Modify the `temperature` parameter:

```python
temperature=0.3  # More focused, consistent
temperature=0.7  # Balanced (default)
temperature=0.9  # More creative, varied
```

## Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured"
‚úÖ **Solution**: Add your API key to `.env` file

### "Failed to fetch team data"
‚úÖ **Solution**: Check internet connection, NHL API may be temporarily down

### "Rate limit exceeded"
‚úÖ **Solution**: You've hit OpenAI rate limits, wait a minute and try again

### Slow Analysis (>30 seconds)
‚úÖ **Solution**: Normal for GPT-4. Switch to gpt-3.5-turbo for faster results

## Development

### Run with Auto-Reload

```bash
uvicorn matchup_analyzer:app --reload --port 8001
```

### Test API Directly

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
